#_04_TestngEnabled

Occasionally, we want to disable some tests because of some reasons
(like a particular api being tested in those tests is changing but
 we donâ€™t want to stop the complete CI build which apart from this
 API should be working fine). In those situations, we can simply
 ignore/disable those tests by setting enabled attribute of @Test
 annotation to false

###Example:

     @Test(enabled = false)
        public void testSubtract() {//We are disabling this test. Look at enabled=false with @Test
            System.out.println("testSubtract()");
            Assert.assertEquals(calculator.subtract(5, 2), 3.0);
        }

###Output:

        setup()
        beforeMethod()
        testAdd()
        afterMethod()
        tearDown()
        PASSED: testAdd
